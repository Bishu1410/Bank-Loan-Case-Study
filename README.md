# Bank-Loan-Case-Study
Here we are trying to build a system through which we will be able to
track the risk of providing or declining a loan prospect. Through this
Bank loan analytics we will measure certain parameters which in turn
will help us grow as a company and also most certainly help in
understanding our flaws. By this way the banks get to know about the
defaulter, the high risk customer and those who pay in time. These
analytics are the foundation pillar of the success of any banking
organisation. Situation such as- Approved, Cancelled, Refused or
Unused offer are those situation which can occur when a client seeks
for loan from a bank so in order to arrive at any conclusion we would
first be able to analyse the clients previous loan background.
I have been given a dataset of a bank various columns of different
parameters is given. Knowledge in statistics and different formulas in
excel are used to draw necessary conclusions about the defaulters.
